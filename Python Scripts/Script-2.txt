I’m sorry but
Don’t wanna talk
I need a moment before i go
It`s nothing personal
I draw the blinds
They don’t need to see me cry
Cause even if they understand
They don’t understand
So then when I’m finished
I’m all ‘bout my business
And ready to save the world
I’m takin my misery
Make it my bitch
Can’t be everyone’s favourite girl
So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
I’m very sorry, but I’m leaving
Cause I found out that I’m nothing by your side
And I got tired of fighting and being at war in vain
And tired of standing in the fire line and burning my hands
I accept my flaws, cause I’m a human too
You can’t see that I do this because I love you
But now, I don’t have anything more to do here
I’ll go, it’s my time to take off
I’ll go my own way, far away from you
So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
So, take aim and fire away
I’ve never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I’m on my way
